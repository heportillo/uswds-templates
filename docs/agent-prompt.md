# AI Agent Instructions for USWDS Template Generation v2.0

## üéØ Mission
Create beautiful, accessible, and emotionally intelligent USWDS templates that serve real people in real government scenarios. Every template should tell a story, solve a problem, and respect the user's time and dignity.

## üöÄ Quick Start Command
When user says: `#create-template [type] [variant] [name]`
Example: `#create-template dashboard plain energy-consumption`

## üìê Design Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **Empathy First**: Consider the emotional state of users (stressed, confused, hopeful)
2. **Clarity Over Cleverness**: Simple, clear interfaces that guide users
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Show what's needed when it's needed
4. **Respect for Time**: Every interaction should feel efficient
5. **Dignity in Design**: Government services should feel professional and trustworthy

## üìñ Template Story Framework

### Before Creating Any Template, Define:

```yaml
template_story:
  persona: 
    name: "Maria Rodriguez"
    role: "Case Worker"
    context: "Managing 150+ active cases, needs quick status updates"
    pain_points: 
      - "Can't see all critical information at once"
      - "Too many clicks to common actions"
      - "Loses context when switching between cases"
    emotional_state: "Overwhelmed but determined"
  
  user_journey:
    trigger: "Morning case review routine"
    goal: "Review overnight changes and prioritize day"
    success_metric: "Can review 20 cases in under 10 minutes"
    
  data_story:
    source: "Real-time from 5 integrated systems"
    update_frequency: "Every 30 seconds for critical metrics"
    peak_load: "Monday mornings, 500+ concurrent users"
    
  conversion_considerations:
    react_hooks: ["useState for filters", "useEffect for polling"]
    api_endpoints: ["/api/cases", "/api/metrics", "/api/alerts"]
    state_management: "Context API for user preferences"
```

## üé® Design Quality Standards

### Text & Typography
```css
/* ALWAYS handle text overflow elegantly */
.metric-value {
  overflow: hidden;
  text-overflow: ellipsis;
  white-space: nowrap;
  max-width: 100%;
}

/* Use responsive font sizes */
.metric-label {
  font-size: clamp(0.875rem, 2vw, 1rem);
}

/* Ensure readable line lengths */
.content-text {
  max-width: 65ch; /* Optimal reading length */
}
```

### Responsive Breakpoints
```html
<!-- Mobile First: 320px minimum -->
<div class="grid-col-12 tablet:grid-col-6 desktop:grid-col-3">
  <!-- Content adapts at each breakpoint -->
</div>

<!-- Always test at these viewports -->
<!-- 320px (mobile), 640px (tablet), 1024px (desktop), 1400px (widescreen) -->
```

### Visual Hierarchy
1. **Primary Action**: One clear primary action per view
2. **Secondary Actions**: 2-3 supporting actions maximum
3. **Information Density**: 
   - Dashboard: High density, scannable
   - Forms: Low density, focused
   - Tables: Medium density, sortable

## üìä Content Intelligence

### Replace Generic Placeholders with Contextual Data

#### ‚ùå WRONG - Generic Placeholders
```html
<span>METRIC1_VALUE</span>
<p>METRIC1_DESC</p>
```

#### ‚úÖ CORRECT - Contextual, Realistic Data
```html
<!-- For Energy Dashboard -->
<span class="font-sans-3xl text-bold">324 MWh</span>
<p class="margin-top-1 text-base">
  <span class="text-base-dark">Daily consumption</span>
  <span class="usa-tag bg-green margin-left-1">‚Üì 12% from yesterday</span>
</p>
```

### Data Generation Rules by Context

#### Government Metrics Should Be:
- **Realistic**: Use actual government scale numbers
- **Specific**: Include units, timeframes, comparisons
- **Meaningful**: Show relationships between metrics
- **Dynamic**: Include trends, changes, status

#### Examples by Dashboard Type:
```javascript
const dashboardMetrics = {
  energy: {
    consumption: "324 MWh",
    renewable: "42%",
    cost: "$1.2M",
    reliability: "99.97%"
  },
  healthcare: {
    claims: "12,847",
    avgProcessTime: "3.2 days",
    satisfaction: "87%",
    denialRate: "4.2%"
  },
  immigration: {
    applications: "8,432",
    avgWaitTime: "127 days",
    approvalRate: "73%",
    interviews: "342 scheduled"
  }
}
```

## üß© Component Pattern Library

### Card Patterns

#### Metric Card with Trend
```html
<div class="usa-card">
  <div class="usa-card__container">
    <div class="usa-card__header">
      <h3 class="usa-card__heading">Active Cases</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="usa-card__body">
      <div class="display-flex flex-align-end flex-justify">

## üìù Metadata Template

Every template should include this metadata block:

```html
<!-- 
Template: Energy Consumption Dashboard
Story: Facility managers monitor real-time energy usage across 50+ buildings
Persona: John, Facilities Director, needs to identify inefficiencies quickly
Emotional State: Pressured to reduce costs while maintaining operations
Key Metrics: Consumption (MWh), Cost ($), Efficiency (%), Renewable (%)
Update Frequency: Real-time (30 second polling)
Peak Usage: 8-10 AM when buildings open
React Considerations: 
  - useState for building selection
  - useEffect for data polling
  - Context for user preferences
  - Memo for expensive calculations
Accessibility Focus: Keyboard navigation between buildings critical
Mobile Usage: 40% of users check on phones during facility walks
-->
```

## üéØ Success Criteria

A successfully created template:
1. **Tells a Story**: Clear narrative of who uses it and why
2. **Feels Real**: Uses realistic data and scenarios  
3. **Handles Edge Cases**: Long names, missing data, errors
4. **Responds Beautifully**: Looks great on all devices
5. **Loads Quickly**: Optimized and performant
6. **Accessible to All**: Keyboard, screen reader, and more

## üåü Creative Excellence at Scale

### Systematic Creativity
1. **Start with the Story**: Who, what, why, when, where
2. **Design the Emotion**: How should users feel?
3. **Craft the Flow**: Natural, intuitive progression
4. **Perfect the Details**: Micro-interactions matter
5. **Test the Edge Cases**: Break it, then fix it

### Batch Processing Patterns
When creating multiple templates:
1. Define shared components first
2. Create consistent data models
3. Establish naming conventions
4. Build reusable utilities
5. Document patterns for reuse

## üìö Reference Implementation

### Example: High-Quality Dashboard Creation

```bash
# Step 1: Define the story
Story: Energy managers at GSA need to monitor consumption across federal buildings 
to meet sustainability goals while managing costs.

# Step 2: Create realistic metrics
- Real-time consumption: Updates every 30 seconds
- Historical comparisons: Show trends
- Cost implications: Connect usage to budget
- Sustainability goals: Progress indicators

# Step 3: Design for emotion
- Calm color palette for routine monitoring
- Yellow/red only for true alerts
- Celebratory green for achievements
- Clear hierarchy reduces scanning time

# Step 4: Handle edge cases
- Buildings offline: Show last known + status
- Data delays: Indicate stale data gracefully
- Extreme values: Format large numbers readably
- Missing data: Explain why and what to do

# Step 5: Optimize performance
- Lazy load historical data
- Virtualize long lists
- Optimize images
- Progressive enhancement
```

## üîÑ Continuous Improvement

After creating each template:
1. **Review against this guide**
2. **Test on real devices**
3. **Get feedback from users**
4. **Document lessons learned**
5. **Update patterns library**
6. **Share with team**

Remember: We're not just building interfaces, we're serving people at important moments in their lives. Every template is an opportunity to make government services more human, more helpful, and more hopeful.
